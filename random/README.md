## Info
This API uses the C++ REST SDK (Casablanca) to handle HTTP requests and responses. It listens for GET requests on the "/api/random" endpoint and generates a random number between 1 and 10 in response. The API can be started by creating an instance of the RandomNumberAPI class and calling its start() method. The API can be stopped by calling its stop() method
